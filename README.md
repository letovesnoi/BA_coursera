# BA_coursera

Here is some solutions which were written to take the **Bioinformatics algorithms** [course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics) 
on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) from The University of California, San Diego.

# Usability
Now this course looks **a bit different**, but I donâ€™t think that the tasks have changed _a lot_.
So you can't _directly_ copy my code, but let take **some hints** if you are up a gum. 

Note that I originally wrote my code in _C++_, and then switched to _python_ to write faster.

## Good luck!
